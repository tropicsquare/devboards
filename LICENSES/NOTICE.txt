License Compatibility Notes:
============================

✅ COMPATIBLE:
- STM32 HAL (BSD-3-Clause) is compatible with Clear BSD License
- Both are permissive open-source licenses
- Can be combined and redistributed together

⚠️ RESTRICTED:
- Microsoft Azure RTOS has hardware-specific restrictions
- Not fully "open source" in the OSI sense
- Limits portability to non-STM32 platforms
- Users must ensure compliance with Microsoft license terms

Hardware Designs:
=================

Hardware designs (PCB layouts, schematics, mechanical designs) in this 
repository are licensed under:

CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive (CERN-OHL-P-2.0)
Copyright (c) 2024 Tropic Square
License File: LICENSE.txt

This is a permissive open hardware license allowing free use, modification,
and distribution of hardware designs.

---

How to Comply with These Licenses:
===================================

When using this repository:

1. Hardware Designs (CERN-OHL-P):
   - You may freely use, modify, and distribute the PCB designs
   - Retain the copyright notice and license information
   - Provide attribution to Tropic Square

2. Tropic Square Firmware (Clear BSD):
   - You may freely use, modify, and distribute the firmware code
   - Retain copyright notices in source and binary distributions
   - Include disclaimer text in distributions

3. STM32 HAL (BSD-3-Clause):
   - Retain STMicroelectronics copyright notices
   - Include disclaimer text in distributions
   - Do not use STMicroelectronics name for endorsement

4. Azure RTOS / USBX (Microsoft Proprietary):
   - Only use with STM32U5 hardware (or other licensed hardware)
   - Include Microsoft license terms with any distribution
   - Cannot modify for use on non-licensed hardware
   - Review full Microsoft license before any commercial use

---

Recommendations for Users:
===========================

For Maximum Openness:
If you want a fully open-source solution without hardware restrictions,
consider replacing the Azure RTOS/USBX component with an open alternative:
- TinyUSB (MIT License) - Recommended
- CherryUSB (Apache 2.0)
- libusb (LGPL for embedded use)

This would make the entire firmware stack truly open and portable.

Questions or Issues:
====================

For licensing questions or clarifications, please:
- Review the full license texts in their respective directories
- Consult with legal counsel for commercial or distribution use
- Contact Tropic Square for questions about hardware or firmware licenses
- Contact STMicroelectronics or Microsoft for third-party component questions
